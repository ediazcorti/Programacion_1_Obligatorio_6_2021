One Page App - Repositorio de respaldo del proyecto

Front end single-page application, designed to work as a study platfornm app for music teachers and students, in which professors can have distinct study groups assigned for diverse levels with every student assigned to one teacher, group and level. In this platform, each user has access to assessments, corrections, uploading their homework and checking on what has been done to the moment. This only presents features made on the front-end, no database has been used for this app. 

Features:

Teachers can register, login, create and modify assignments and correct the assignments online with an object which works as an object which includes the score and pertinent corrections. They have acces to statistics as being able to check which students have sent more tasks with percentages and integer numbers on screen.

Students can register, login, create and modify their deliverables for the teachers to check on and correct. These deliverables are their own objects which include text, images and the student's audio for the current task which they are uploading their work about. They can also check the requirements of each assesment since they have access to them through their teacher's groups. They also have access to statistics such as which and how many tasks have they already delivered, how many of them were already given a correction and they are able to check the document of the teacher's corrections regards each of their assessments.

Known bugs: This app could have various bugs around correction objects or some of the register functionalities because it was finished and delivered in a limited time, and it was not tested further afterwards. Main issues could be some occasioned regards some variables which should have been parsed to other types after implementing features, which ended up breaking some functionality after updating builds but there was a time limit and we tried to go further beyond of what was actually asked us to do so.
